{"name":"Aerospace Toolbox","tagline":"A collection of functions for aerospace analysis.","body":"The Aerospace Toolbox for Python contains functions intended for aerospace engineering analysis to develop and evaluate designs. The toolbox is developed (and currently only tested) in a Python 2.7.5 environment and requires Numpy/Scipy. The toolbox is designed to allow quick and robust evaluation of functions and to properly accept and handle multidimensional matrices/array's. Currently, the toolbox contains the following:\r\n\r\n*Environment* (accepts multidimensional arrays as input)\r\n- **stdmodel**: Define a standard atmosphere model with custom parameters such as gravity and lapserate.\r\n- **stdatmos**: Evaluate any standard atmosphere (default=ISA) at a given geometrical, geopotential, absolute, pressure, temperature or density-altitude.\r\n- **geoidheight**: Calculate the geoid height at any coordinate using the EGM96 Geopotential Model.\r\n\r\n*Aerodynamics* (can convert multidimensional arrays from any property to another):\r\n- **flowisentropic**: Isentropic relations with a given set of specific heat ratios and any one of the isentropic flow variables.\r\n- **flownormalshock**: Normal shock relations with a given set of specific heat ratios and any one of the normal shock variables.\r\n- **flowprandtlmeyer**: Prandtl-Meyer function for expansion waves.\r\n\r\n*Unit Conversion* (can convert multidimensional arrays from any unit to another):\r\n- **convert**: easy conversion of units, such as mass, pressure and density.\r\n\r\nThe Aerospace Toolbox for Python is created to (partially) look like the equivalent set of functions in the matlab aerospace toolbox: http://www.mathworks.nl/help/aerotbx/index.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
