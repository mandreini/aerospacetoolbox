{"name":"Aerospace Toolbox","tagline":"A collection of functions for Python 2.7","body":"The Aerospace Toolbox for Python contains a collection of functions intended for aerospace engineering applications. The Toolbox is developed (and currently only tested) in a Python 2.7 environment and requires a recent distribution of NumPy and SciPy. The Toolbox is designed to allow quick and robust evaluation of different functions and to properly accept and handle array-like data structures.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* All functions accept input data in any form that can be converted to an array. This includes scalars, lists, tuples, matrices and ndarrays. Each functions returns it's results in original form.\r\n* The theoretical formulas are evaluated by either direct substition or iteration with the Newton-Raphson method if the former is not possible.\r\n* Includes a module which wraps most of the functions in [MATLAB Aerospace Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.nl/help/aerotbx/index.html) syntax.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to obtain the most recent version of the Aerospace Toolbox is by downloading the source as a [ZIP-file](https://github.com/wilcoschoneveld/aerospacetoolbox/zipball/master). Extract the contents to a folder and install the package by running the following command:\r\n\r\n````\r\npython setup.py install\r\n````\r\n\r\nA Python 2.7 distribution with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) is needed in order to make proper use of the Aerospace Toolbox. A recent version of [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) is required to run the example scripts.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n### Contact","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
