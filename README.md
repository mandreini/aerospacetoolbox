Aerospace Toolbox
================

The Aerospace Toolbox for Python contains a collection of functions intended for aerospace engineering applications. This version of the toolbox is being developed and tested for a Python 3.4 environment and requires a recent version of NumPy and SciPy (exact versions TBD). The toolbox is designed to allow quick and robust evaluation of different functions and to properly accept and handle array-like data structures.
