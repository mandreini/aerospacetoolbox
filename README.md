Aerospace Toolbox
================

The Aerospace Toolbox for Python contains a collection of functions intended for aerospace engineering applications. The toolbox is developed (and currently tested only) in a Python 2.7 environment and requires a recent version of NumPy and SciPy. The toolbox is designed to allow quick and robust evaluation of different functions and to properly accept and handle array-like data structures.
